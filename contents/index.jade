        h5 Education
        p The Bitcoin Association of Berkeley strives to be the de facto hub of cryptocurrency related activity in the East Bay, and takes a strong initiative to educate people about Bitcoin, the blockchain, and their implications from economic, technological, and financial perspectives. We run workshops for people new to Bitcoin development, organize education-oriented tech talks, and will be teaching a Bitcoin Decal in the Fall. These activities coalesce at our general meetings, during which we discuss recent industry, technological, and economic developments.

        h5 Innovation
        p As an organization, we hope to foster cryptocurrency-related innovation in the East Bay. Our gatherings in the D Lab of Barrows Hall are a unique place where enterprising individuals can seek guidance and support for their projects. Every year, the Bitcoin Association of Berkeley puts on Bay Bithack, known to be the first and largest collegiate blockchain hackathon in the world, where collegiate hackers from all over the Bay Area help revolutionize the way we think about money and decentralized systems. We also contribute to the cryptocurrency ecosystem ourselves by developing open-source projects together as a club.

        h5 Community
        p We are a collection of self-accomplished individuals all involved with Bitcoin in some way, both technical and nontechnical, and tout the best professional connections to Bitcoin industry that any UC Berkeley student organization can offer. Perhaps the most important feature of the Bitcoin Association of Berkeley is that weâ€™re a tight-knit group of friends, and connect on a level much deeper than simply our shared interest in cryptocurrency. As examples of this, we go to dinner after every Tuesday meeting, and periodically host our own socials.
