        h5 About
        p The Cryptocurrency Decal is a comprehensive survey of relevant topics in cryptocurrency and the wider blockchain space. From a technological standpoint, we start with the basics of cryptography and economics, establish a solid fundamental understanding of Bitcoin by building it from the bottom up, and from there, explore the myriad of ideas and technologies relating to blockchain technology. On the non-technical side, we start with the history of digital currency, then look at the laws, organizations, trends, and communities behind it to build a complete picture of the ecosystem surrounding blockchain technology.

        h5 Goal
        p Many people find it difficult to understand cryptocurrency because cryptocurrencies require the coordination of many components for it to function, and it's hard to see the full picture until all the individual components are fully understood. Furthermore, since the field is very technical and relatively new, cryptocurrency-related discussion by nature is full of jargon. Therefore, it is easy to get lost trying to follow nearly any conversation on cryptocurrency if you have not built up the right background.
        p Therefore, the goal of this course is to surmount the steep learning curve of cryptocurrency. By the end of this course you will understand how cryptocurrencies work and the ideas, technologies, and organizations sprouting from it.

      | Homework: The homework format is a half to one-page typed (double spaced, Times New Roman, 12 point font) writing assignment, with prompts emailed shortly after class.

Assignments on the previous week's topic are due at the beginning of class, and may be turned in as a hard copy or emailed to facilitators. You are allowed to miss one homework assignment without having it affect your grade.
